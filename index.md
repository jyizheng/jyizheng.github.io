## Research Interests
My research focuses on the design and implementation of efficient and secure data management systems. I work on write-optimized index data structures for high-speed storage systems. I am developing a general-purpose in-kernel file system on Linux that provides compelling performance on micro-write intensive workloads.

Explore my research on secure persistent key-value stores using SGX/TrustZone for data protection against malicious OS attacks.
